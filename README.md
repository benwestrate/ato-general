# ato-general

This is a container Repo to hold my home automation work. This has repo has a bunch of different things related to what I have dubbed ATO. There are [designs](https://github.com/benwestrate/ato-general/tree/master/Designs), [Lambdas](https://github.com/benwestrate/ato-general/tree/master/lambas), and [hardware](https://github.com/benwestrate/ato-general/tree/master/hardware) node code. 

The code included here is does not have any of the credentials nessisary to make it work, with that said you could create your own AWS, Auth0, and or Particle access keys for your own set up and use those.
